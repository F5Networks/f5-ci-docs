OVERALL QUESTIONS:
------------------
- WHAT DO WE MANAGE AUTOMATICALLY?
- WHAT DOES THE USER HAVE TO MANAGE?
- WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN L2 & L3 AUTOMATION IN THESE USE CASES? (THE ROUTING TABLE UPDATES)

.. todo:: Ask Brian M for his table on what the user has to manage manually vs what's automatic / what's just done for initial setup vs what requires ongoing management

How the F5 Integration fits in to Kubernetes Cluster Networks
=============================================================

The |kctlr-long| controller configures services on the BIG-IP device to expose applications inside your Kubernetes cluster to external users.
In some deployments, the |kctlr| also makes network configurations on the BIG-IP system.

There are a number of options when it comes to connecting a BIG-IP device (platform or Virtual Edition) to a Kubernetes cluster network.

- :ref:`Cluster overlay networks`
- :ref:`Cluster routed networks`
- :ref:`Kubernetes NodePort`

   See the Kubernetes `Cluster Networking`_ Administration Guide for more information about setting up a Kubernetes cluster network.

.. _cluster overlay networks:

Cluster Overlay Networks
------------------------

In a Cluster Overlay Network, the BIG-IP system connects to an L2 overlay (a VLAN).
The nodes in a Kubernetes cluster connect to the overlay by means of VXLANs.

.. figure:: /_static/media/k8s-sdn-vxlan_copy.png
   :scale: 60%

In this deployment, you'll need to make some initial configurations on the BIG-IP system.

#. Create a new VLAN and self IP address.

   - The VLAN corresponds to the L2 overlay providing connectivity to the nodes in your cluster.
   - The VLAN connects to an untaffed interface on the BIG-IP platform (in this example, ``1.1``).
   - The self IP address will serve as the VXLAN tunnel endpoint; set it to an IP address available in the overlay VLAN.

   .. code-block:: console

      tmsh create net vlan k8s_vlan interfaces add { 1.1 }
      tmsh create net self 1.2.3.4 vlan k8s_vlan

#. Create a new ``vxlan`` tunnel profile and a VXLAN tunnel.

   - Set the ``flooding-type`` to ``multi-point``.
   - Use the self IP address as the tunnel's ``local-address``.

   .. code-block:: console

      tmsh create net tunnels vxlan vxlan-mp flooding-type multipoint
      tmsh create net tunnels tunnel k8s_vxlan profile vxlan-mp local-address 1.2.3.4

   .. important::

      Be sure to use the correct encapsulation format for your network.

#. Create **FDB entries** and **ARP records** for the cluster endpoints.
   For instructions, see **Examples for manually populating L2 location records** in the `BIG-IP TMOS: â€‹Tunneling and IPsec <https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-tmos-tunnels-ipsec-13-0-0/2.html>`_ guide.

OpenShift SDN
`````````````

The OpenShift SDN cluster overlay setup is similar to the standard Kubernetes setup, but it has a few key differences.

- Instead of setting up a VLAN and self IP on the BIG-IP system, you'll :ref:`create a host subnet <k8s-openshift-hostsubnet>` in your OpenShift cluster.
- The ``hostIP`` address assigned to the BIG-IP device from the host subnet provides the means of connecting the BIG-IP to the L2 overlay.
- If using the ``ovs-multitenant`` plugin, assign the BIG-IP device the OpenShift ``VNID 0`` to grant it access to all projects. [#originsdn]_
- In OpenShift, the |kctlr-long| is route-aware; it automatically discovers FDB entries and updates the BIG-IP system accordingly.

See :ref:`How to add your BIG-IP device to an OpenShift Cluster <bigip-openshift-setup>` for complete setup instructions.

.. _cluster routed networks:

Cluster Routed Networks
-----------------------

In a cluster routed network, the BIG-IP device connects to a flat IP network.

.. figure:: /_static/media/k8s-direct_2_copy.png
   :scale: 60%

In this model, the Kubernetes master assigns IP addresses to all Pods.
You'll need to manually configure routes on the BIG-IP system so it can discover all Pod IP addresses on the cluster network.

See the `BIG-IP TMOS Routing Administration`_ guide for more information about managing routes on your BIG-IP device.

Project Calico
``````````````

You can use `Calico for Kubernetes`_ as part of a cluster routed network.


Calico BGP https://docs.projectcalico.org/v2.4/usage/configuration/bgp

Questions:

- How does this work?
- What BIG-IP pre-configs are required?
- Do we have to set up VLANs on BIG-IP

We understand the control plane and there's no encapsulation required.
