Nodeport mode vs Cluster mode
=============================

If you're setting up a Kubernetes cluster and/or the |kctlr-long| for the first time, you may be asking yourself *"What is the pool-member-type setting and which mode should I choose?"*.
This document clarifies the available options and provides vital information to take into account when making this decision.

In brief: The :code:`pool-member-type` setting determines what mode the Controller runs in -- :code:`nodeport` or :code:`cluster`.

.. _nodeport mode:

Nodeport mode
-------------

:code:`Nodeport` mode is the default mode of operation for the |kctlr|.
From a configuration standpoint, it's easier to set up and more compatible with the `Kubernetes Cluster`_, as it doesn't require you to add your BIG-IP system to the Kubernetes `Cluster Network`_.

As shown in the diagram below, :code:`nodeport` mode uses 2-tier load balancing: the |kctlr| load balances requests to Nodes, which in turn load balance requests to Pods.

.. figure:: /_static/media/k8s_nodeport.png


**Important limitations to consider:**

- The `Kubernetes Services`_ you want to manage must use :code:`type: NodePort`.
- You can't use the full BIG-IP feature set (L7 services like persistence are not available).
- Introduces extra latency.
- BIG-IP system can't load balance directly to Pods.
- |kctlr| has limited visibility into Pod health.

If you want to use NodePort mode, continue on to :ref:`Install the BIG-IP Controller in Kubernetes <install-kctlr>`.

.. _cluster mode:

Cluster mode
------------

You should use :code:`Cluster` mode if you intend to integrate your BIG-IP device into the Kubernetes cluster network. [#clusternet]_
While there are additional networking configurations to make, there are distinct benefits:

- You can use any type you like for your Kubernetes Services.
- You get the full BIG-IP ADC functionality, including L7 persistence.
- BIG-IP system can load balance directly to any Pod in the Cluster.
- |kctlr| has full visibility into Pod health, via the Kubernetes API.

.. _k8s-cluster-networks:

If you want to run |kctlr| in cluster mode, continue on to :ref:`Network considerations`.
The following guides provide relevant information and instructions:

- The Kubernetes `Cluster Networking`_ Administration Guide -- provides information about Kubernetes Cluster Network types.
- The `BIG-IP TMOS: â€‹Tunneling and IPsec <https://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-tmos-tunnels-ipsec-13-0-0/2.html>`_ Guide -- provides instructions for setting up tunnels on your BIG-IP device.

When thinking about how to integrate your BIG-IP device into the cluster network, you'll probably want to take into account what you have to do manually vs what the |kctlr| takes care of automatically.
In general, the manual operations required occur far less frequently than those that are automatic.
The list below shows common operations for a typical Kubernetes cluster, from most-frequent to least-frequent.

- Add or remove Pods from an existing Service, or expose a Service with Pods.
- Add or remove a Node from the Cluster.
- Create a new Kubernetes Cluster from scratch.

The |kctlr| **always manages BIG-IP system configurations for Pods automatically.**
For Nodes and Clusters, you may have to perform some actions manually (or automate them using a different system, like Ansible). [#ansible]_
Take these into consideration if you're deciding how to set up your cluster network, or deciding how to integrate the |kctlr| and a BIG-IP device into an existing cluster.

.. tip::

   BIG-IP platforms `support several overlay networks`_, like VXLAN, NVGRE, and IPIP.
   The manual steps noted in the table apply when integrating a BIG-IP device into any overlay network, not just the examples shown here.
