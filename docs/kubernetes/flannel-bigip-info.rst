BIG-IP and flannel VXLAN Integration
====================================

This document provides a general overview of the BIG-IP device integration with flannel VXLAN in Kubernetes. For set-up instructions, see :ref:`use-bigip-k8s-flannel`.

Overview of Cluster Networking with flannel in Kubernetes
---------------------------------------------------------

.. seealso::

   Read about the Kubernetes `Cluster Network`_ and `Using flannel with Kubernetes`_.

`Flannel`_ is a layer 3 network fabric (or, in their words, "a virtual network that attaches IP addresses to containers"). In Kubernetes, flannel runs as a Pod on each Node in the Cluster. The Pod contains the flannel daemon -- :code:`flanneld` -- that provides network information to Nodes and reads information about Nodes from the Kubernetes API server.

Flannel assigns a subnet to each Kubernetes Node. It allocates an IP address within that subnet to each Pod running on the Node. Because :code:`flanneld` runs on every Node, all of the Pods across the Cluster can talk to each other directly.

.. note::

   In older versions of Kubernetes (pre-1.6), flannel used an ``etcd`` key-value store to read and write information about Kubernetes Nodes. Though ``etcd`` is still viable in later versions, it's not commonly used.

BIG-IP Devices and the Kubernetes Cluster Network
-------------------------------------------------

As discussed in :ref:`kctlr modes`, when a BIG-IP device is part of the Kubernetes Cluster Network, it can load balance directly to any Pod in the Cluster. This is the case because, via flannel and the |kctlr|, the BIG-IP can find each Pod's :code:`public-ip` address. Read on for an overview of how this works.

The BIG-IP device connects to the flannel network via a VXLAN tunnel. The |kctlr| populates this tunnel with the following information about the flannel network:

- forwarding database (FDB) records that map the MAC address of each Kubernetes Node's flannel VXLAN interface to the Node IP address;
- static ARP entries that map the flannel VXLAN interface's MAC address to the Pod's flannel :code:`public-ip`.

The |kctlr| also assigns each Pod's flannel :code:`public-ip` address to a node on the BIG-IP.

.. rubric:: **Example:**

Node1 has the NodeIP address, MAC address, and Pod :code:`public-ip` address shown in the table below.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Kubernetes Node1                                                  |
+===============================================+===================+
| Node IP address                               | 172.16.2.10       |
+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------+
| MAC address of Node's flannel VXLAN interface | 98:ba:76:dc:54:fe |
+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------+
| Pod public-ip address assigned by flannel     | 10.244.1.2        |
+-----------------------------------------------+-------------------+

The |kctlr| uses this information to create an FDB record and a static ARP entry for the Node on the BIG-IP system:

.. code-block:: TCL
   :caption: FDB record

   flannel_vxlan {
    records [
       98:ba:76:dc:54:fe {
         endpoint: 172.16.2.10
       }
    ]
   }

.. code-block:: TCL
   :caption: static ARP entry

   {
      name: k8s-10.244.1.2
      ipaddress: 10.244.1.2
      macaddress: 98:ba:76:dc:54:fe
   }

Together, these records tell the BIG-IP device that a Pod on Node1 should receive traffic from the BIG-IP node with the IP address "10.244.1.2".

How flannel knows about the BIG-IP device
-----------------------------------------

At this point, your BIG-IP device knows how to route to the Kubernetes network, but flannel doesn't know about the BIG-IP device. Flannel's :code:`kube-subnet-manager` uses the Kubernetes API to discover information about Kubernetes Nodes. This means that, to add the BIG-IP device to the flannel network, we need to add the BIG-IP device as a Node in Kubernetes.

When you add a new Node to Kubernetes to represent the BIG-IP device, :ref:`add the flannel Annotations <add flannel annotations>` and podCIDR to the Node resource. Once the Node is up and running, flannel will discover its Annotations and add the BIG-IP device to the VXLAN.
 
With all of these pieces in place, you can successfully send traffic from (or through) a BIG-IP virtual server to a specific Kubernetes Pod!
