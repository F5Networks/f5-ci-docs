BIG-IP Controller troubleshooting
---------------------------------

.. hint::

   You can use `kubectl`_ commands to check the |kctlr| configurations using the command line.

   .. code-block:: console

      kubectl get pod -o yaml [--namespace=kube-system]          \\ Returns the Pod's YAML settings
      kubectl describe pod myBigIpCtlr [--namespace=kube-system] \\ Returns an information dump about the Pod you can use to troubleshoot specific issues

.. hint::

   When in doubt, restart the Controller.

   Just like your wifi at home, sometimes you just need to turn it off and turn it back on again. With the |kctlr|, you can do this by deleting the ``k8s-bigip-ctlr`` Pod. A new Pod deploys automatically, thanks to the `ReplicaSet`_.

   .. code-block:: console

      kubectl get pod --namespace=kube-system
      NAME                             READY     STATUS            RESTARTS   AGE
      k8s-bigip-ctlr-687734628-7fdds   0/1       CrashLoopBackoff  2          15d

      kubectl delete pod k8s-bigip-ctlr-687734628-7fdds --namespace=kube-system

      kubectl logs --previous k8s-bigip-ctlr-687734628-7fdds --namespace=kube-system


How do I set the log level?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change the log level for the |kctlr|:

#. Annotate the :ref:`Deployment <k8s-bigip-ctlr-deployment>` for the |kctlr|.

   .. code-block:: console

      kubectl annotate k8s-bigip-ctlr.yaml "--log-level=DEBUG" --namespace=kube-system

#. Verify the Deployment updated successfully.

   .. code-block:: console

      kubectl describe deployment k8s-bigip-ctlr -o wide --namespace=kube-system

Why didn't the k8s-bigip-ctlr show up when I ran "get pods"?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you launched the |kctlr| in the ``--kube-system`` namespace, you should add the ``--namespace`` flag to your :command:`kubectl get` command.

.. code-block:: console

   kubectl get pod --namespace=kube-system
   kubectl get pod myBigIpCtlr --namespace=kube-system

-----------------------------------------


The BIG-IP pool members use the Kubernetes Node IPs instead of the Pod IPs
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

The |kctlr| uses node IPs when running in its default mode, ``nodeport``. See :ref:`Nodeport mode vs Cluster mode <kctlr modes>` for more information.

-----------------------------------------

Why didn't the BIG-IP Controller create any objects on my BIG-IP?
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Check the |kctlr| settings against those of the Service you want it to watch to make sure everything aligns correctly.

Do the namespaces match?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the |kctlr| watches all Kubernetes `Namespaces`_ (as of v1.3.0). If you do specify a Namespace to watch in the k8s-bigip-ctlr Deployment, make sure it matches that of the Kubernetes Resources you want to manage.

In the examples below, the Namespace in the Service doesn't match that provided in the sample Deployment. [#servicesrc]_

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: Sample Kubernetes Service
   :emphasize-lines: 4,5

   kind: Service
   apiVersion: v1
   metadata:
     name: hello
   namespace: test


.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: Excerpt from a sample Deployment
   :emphasize-lines: 12-13

   apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
   kind: Deployment
   metadata:
     name: k8s-bigip-ctlr-deployment
     namespace: kube-system
   ...
             args: [
               "--bigip-username=$(BIGIP_USERNAME)",
               "--bigip-password=$(BIGIP_PASSWORD)",
               "--bigip-url=10.10.10.10",
               "--bigip-partition=kubernetes",
               # THE LINE BELOW TELLS THE CONTROLLER WHAT NAMESPACE TO WATCH
               "--namespace=prod",
               ]
   ...


Are the Service name and port correct?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Make sure the name and port in your virtual server ConfigMap match those defined for the Service.

==============================   ==================================
Service field                    ConfigMap ``data.data.`` field
==============================   ==================================
metadata.name                    virtualServer.backend.serviceName
spec.ports.[port | targetPort]   virtualServer.backend.servicePort
==============================   ==================================

In the examples below, the servicePort and serviceName don't match the name and port in the example Service. [#servicesrc]_

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: Sample Kubernetes Service
   :emphasize-lines: 4,13

   kind: Service
   apiVersion: v1

Do the service types match?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default type used for `Service resources`_ in Kubernetes is ``clusterIP``. The corresponding setting for the k8s-bigip-ctlr -- ``pool-member-type`` -- defaults to ``nodeport``.

**If you didn't specify a type** in the Service definition --OR-- a ``pool-member-type`` in the |kctlr| Deployment, you probably have a service type mismatch.

See :ref:`Nodeport mode vs Cluster mode <kctlr modes>` for more information about each service type and its recommended use.

-----------------------------------------

Why didn't the |kctlr| create the pools/rules for my Ingress?
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

When you create multiple rules in an Ingress that overlap, Kubernetes silently drops all but one of them. If you don't see all of the pools and/or rules you expect to see on the BIG-IP system, double-check your Ingress resource for redundant or overlapping settings.

For example, say you want to create a pool for your website's frontend app, with one (1) pool member for each of the Services comprising the app.

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: Good: 1 rule that includes both Services comprising the frontend app

   host: mysite.example.com
      path: /frontend
      - service: svc1
      - service: svc2

.. code-block:: yaml
   :caption: Bad: 2 rules that both attempt to route traffic for the frontend app

   host: mysite.example.com
      path: /frontend
      - service: svc1

   host: mysite.example.com
      path: /frontend
      - service: svc2

In the latter case, Kubernetes would drop one of the overlapping rules and the |kctlr| would only create one (1) pool member on the BIG-IP system.

-----------------------------------------

Why don't my Annotations work?
``````````````````````````````

Are you using Annotations recommended for a different `Kubernetes Ingress Controller`_ ?

**Annotations aren't universally applicable**. You should only use Annotations included in the list of `Ingress annotations`_ supported by the |kctlr|.

-----------------------------------------

.. _iapp traffic group:

Why did I see a traffic group error when I deployed my iApp?
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

You may see the error below when deploying an iApp. This error means the iApp is attempting to create a vip in a traffic group that conflicts with the partition's default traffic group.

.. code-block:: console

   Configuration error: Unable to to create virtual address (/myPartition/127.0.0.2) as part of application
   (/myPartition/default_k8s.http.app/default_k8s.http) because it matches the self ip (/Common/selfip.external)
   which uses a conflicting traffic group (/Common/traffic-group-local-only)

You should be able to resolve this error by either changing the default traffic group for the partition or specifying the desired traffic group in the F5 resource ConfigMap for the iApp. If these options do not resolve the issue, contact your F5 Support representative for assistance.

.. note::

   The first option is preferred because it only requires a single config change on the BIG-IP system.
   If you don't update this setting for your partition, you will have to specify the correct traffic group in the F5 Resource ConfigMap every time you use the |kctlr| to deploy an iApp.

Change the default traffic group for the partition on the BIG-IP system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use a TMOS shell or the configuration utility to set the default traffic group for the partition the |kctlr| manages.

- In a TMOS shell:

  Run the commands shown below. Substitute the items in bold with the appropriate information for your environment.

  .. parsed-literal::

     modify /sys folder **/<partition>/** traffic-group **<desired-traffic-group>**
     save /sys config partitions all

- In the config utility:

  #. Go to :menuselection:`System --> Users --> Partition List`.
  #. Click on the partition you want to manage.
  #. Select the correct traffic group.
  #. Click :guilabel:`Update`.

Set the desired traffic group in your F5 resource ConfigMap
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Include the following in the :code:`frontend` section of your :ref:`iApp F5 resource <f5-resource-iapp-blob>`:

.. parsed-literal::

   "iappOptions": {
      "description": "os.routing-virtual iApp",
      **"trafficGroup": "/Common/traffic-group-1"**
   },

.. note::

   If you choose this option, you must specify the desired traffic group every time you use the |kctlr| to deploy an iApp.
