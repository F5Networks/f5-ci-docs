Manage BIG-IP Objects
=====================

The |mctlr-long| watches the Mesos/Marathon API for Applications with associated :ref:`F5 Application Labels <app-labels>`.
These Application Labels define the BIG-IP LTM objects |mctlr| creates/manages.

The example JSON blob shown below tells |mctlr| to create one (1) virtual server - with one (1) health monitor and one (1) pool - in the ``/mesos`` partition on the BIG-IP device.

.. literalinclude:: /marathon/config_examples/hello-marathon-example.json
   :caption: Example F5 Application Labels defining a BIG-IP virtual server
   :lines: 8,10,14-17

.. tip::

   You can also :ref:`deploy iApps with the marathon-bigip-ctlr <mctlr-deploy-iapps>`.

.. _mctlr-create-vs:

Create a BIG-IP virtual server for a Marathon App
-------------------------------------------------

.. note::

   The code samples below use the `basic Hello Marathon App`_.


#. Create a JSON file containing the App service definitions and F5 labels.

   .. note:: This sample App definition shows labels that use the default :ref:`port index <port-mappings>` (``0``).

   .. literalinclude:: /marathon/config_examples/hello-marathon-example.json

   :fonticon:`fa fa-download` :download:`hello-marathon-example.json </marathon/config_examples/hello-marathon-example.json>`


#. Deploy the application in Marathon via the REST API using the JSON file.

   .. code-block:: shell

      curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' http://10.190.25.75:8080/v2/apps -d @hello-marathon-example.json

#. Verify creation of the virtual server, pool, and member in the App's BIG-IP partition via ``tmsh`` or the configuration utility.

   .. code-block:: console

      admin@(bigip)(cfg-sync Standalone)(Active)(/mesos)(tmos)$ show ltm virtual
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Ltm::Virtual Server: basic-0_8080
      ------------------------------------------------------------------
      Status
        Availability     : unknown
        State            : enabled
        Reason           : The children pool member(s) either don't have service checking enabled, or service check results are not available yet
        CMP              : enabled
        CMP Mode         : all-cpus
        Destination      : 10.190.25.70:8080
      ...

.. tip::

   In the above example, the "Availability" is "unknown" because there are no health monitors associated with the virtual server.
   When you add :ref:`health checks <health-checks>` to the App in Marathon, the |mctlr| creates corresponding BIG-IP health monitors.

.. _mctlr-update-vs:

Update a BIG-IP front-end virtual server
----------------------------------------

#. Edit the Application's JSON service definition.

#. Send the updated file to the Marathon API server.

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl -X PUT http://1.2.3.4:8080/v2/apps/basic-0 -d @hello-marathon-example.json -H "Content-type: application/json"
      {"version":"2017-02-21T21:48:12.755Z","deploymentId":"02529d16-258b-41d4-ba06-9765c4d1f8d3"}

#. Verify your changes on the BIG-IP via ``tmsh`` or the configuration utility.

   .. code-block:: bash

      tmsh show ltm virtual

.. _mctlr-delete-objects:

Delete BIG-IP LTM objects
-------------------------

#. Remove the F5 Application Labels from the Application's service definition.

#. Send the updated Application to the Marathon API server.

   .. code-block:: bash

      curl -X PUT http://1.2.3.4:8080/v2/apps/basic-0 -d @hello-marathon-example.json -H "Content-type: application/json"
      {"version":"2017-02-21T21:58:11.111Z","deploymentId":"8bdf03d2-8568-46b3-a5a3-61cc397185a1"}

#. Verify the BIG-IP LTM object(s) no longer exist.

   .. code-block:: bash

      admin@(bigip)(cfg-sync Standalone)(Active)(/mesos)(tmos)$ show ltm virtual
      admin@(bigip)(cfg-sync Standalone)(Active)(/mesos)(tmos)$

.. _mctlr-downed-apps:

Connectivity for down or replaced Applications
----------------------------------------------

If you need to take down a `Marathon Application`_ temporarily and want to keep the associated BIG-IP LTM objects, keep the F5 Application Labels in the application's service definition.
The |mctlr| will continue to manage the associated BIG-IP LTM objects when the App comes back up.
If you deploy a new App with the same name as the one you took down, the |kctlr| associates the existing BIG-IP LTM objects with the new Service.

If you take down an Application and want to remove its corresponding BIG-IP LTM objects, :ref:`delete the F5 Application Labels <mctlr-delete-objects>` from its service definition.

.. _mctlr-pool-only:

Pools without Virtual Servers
-----------------------------

.. include:: /_static/reuse/marathon-version-added-1_1.rst

You can use the |mctlr| to create BIG-IP pools that aren't attached to a front-end virtual server (:dfn:`unattached pools`).
When you create unattached pools, the |mctlr-long| applies the following naming convention to BIG-IP pool members: ``<application-name>_<F5_{n}_PORT>``.
For example, ``pool-only-0_8080``.

.. important::

   The primary use case for unattached pools is to allow the use of an IPAM system to allocate IP addresses for your virtual servers.

   If you create unattached pools and are not using IPAM, the BIG-IP system must have another way to route traffic to the pools (such as `iRules <https://devcentral.f5.com/irules>`_ or `local traffic policies`_).

.. _mctlr-ipam:

Use IPAM to assign IP addresses to BIG-IP virtual servers
`````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

.. include:: /_static/reuse/marathon-version-added-1_1.rst

The |mctlr-long| has a built-in hook that allows you to integrate an IPAM system using a custom plugin.
The basic elements required are:

#. Add the F5 application labels for :ref:`unattached pools <mctlr-pool-only>` to the App definition.
   The |mctlr-long| creates a BIG-IP pool that isn't attached to a virtual server.

#. Set your IPAM system to add the ``F5_{n}_BIND_ADDR`` label and IP address to the Application definition.
   This tells the |mctlr-long| to create a BIG-IP virtual server with the designated IP address and attach the pool to it.

.. _mctlr-create-unattached-pool:

Create a pool without a virtual server
``````````````````````````````````````

#. Create a JSON file containing the App service definitions and F5 application labels, **without the** ``F5_{n}_BIND_ADDR`` **application label**.

   .. note::

      This sample App definition uses the default :ref:`port index <port-mappings>` (``0``).

   .. literalinclude:: /marathon/config_examples/hello-marathon-pool-only-example.json

   :fonticon:`fa fa-download` :download:`hello-marathon-pool-only-example.json </marathon/config_examples/hello-marathon-pool-only-example.json>`

#. Deploy the application in Marathon via the REST API.

   .. code-block:: shell

      curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' http://1.2.3.4:8080/v2/apps -d @hello-marathon-pool-only-example.json

.. _mctlr-delete-unattached-pool:

Delete an unattached pool
`````````````````````````

#. Remove the F5 Application Labels from the Application's service definition.
#. POST the updated App to the Marathon REST API.
#. Use the BIG-IP configuration utility to verify deletion of the pool (:menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Pools`).

.. _mctlr-detach-pool:

Detach a pool from a virtual server
```````````````````````````````````

If you want to delete a front-end BIG-IP virtual server, but keep its associated pool(s)/pool member(s):

#. Remove the ``F5_{n}_BIND_ADDR`` label from the App's service definition.
#. POST the updated App to the Marathon REST API.
#. Use the BIG-IP configuration utility to verify the virtual server no longer exists (:menuselection:`Local Traffic --> Virtual Servers`).
