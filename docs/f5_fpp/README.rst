Release
-------

The current release is |fp_version|.


Overview
--------

The F5® |fp| ™ collects and reports statistics (HTTP and TCP) about services for which it acts as a proxy. In aggregate, these statistics should provide visualization into a distributed application's environment and health. |fp| also provides basic load balancing services for client requests and connections across an application's server pool.

.. important::

    |fp| is designed to be deployed dynamically by the :ref:`F5 FlowPoint Proxy Controller`. As such, we have not provided installation instructions for |fp| in this documentation.
