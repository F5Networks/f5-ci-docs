Overview
--------

Apache Mesos with Marathon provides load balancing using `Mesos-DNS <http://mesosphere.github.io/mesos-dns/>`_. Mesos-DNS polls the Mesos master to find running tasks; it creates DNS records for those tasks, which applications can use to find each other. Because the DNS updates and polling happen periodically, the records can be stale and have slow failover times. The polling rate is outside of admin control in Mesos, so it's not possible to scale it to handle the rate of app bringup/failure. A lack of service-based health checks can result in traffic being sent to a failed application. It can also be difficult for applications and users to access services and apps from outside the Mesos cluster environment.

F5's Container Service Integration (CSI) provides several services beyond the capabilities of Mesos DNS. It enables the use of BIG-IP® as an edge load balancer to expose services outside the Mesos cluster and provides a lightweight proxy service for internal load balancing and service discovery.

The F5 Container Service Integration includes the following services:

- load balancing for external users and applications;
- internal service discovery and load balancing;
- health checks;
- TLS and SSL offload (with BIG-IP for edge load balancing);
- advanced persistence profiles;
- dynamic pool member discovery and updates;
- application visibility via stats collection and per-transaction metrics;
- iApps® to manage customizations, advanced policy, and iRules®.
