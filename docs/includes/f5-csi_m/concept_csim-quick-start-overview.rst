.. rubric:: Overview

This guide describes how to set up a reference F5Â® |csi| in a Mesos environment with Marathon. This guide is intended to help users understand the components and services F5 provides for use in containerized environments.

You do not need a pre-existing Mesos / Marathon environment to follow this guide. We will help you set one up in Amazon Web Services (AWS) using a cloud formation template (CFT).

.. note::

    This guide includes a section on using `Splunk Enterprise <https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html>`_ for data analytics and visualization. If you don't already have a Splunk instance, we recommend signing up for the 60-day evaluation program.

    If you would like to use the F5 |csi_m| in an existing Mesos environment, please see the :ref:`User Guide <csim-user-guide>`.
