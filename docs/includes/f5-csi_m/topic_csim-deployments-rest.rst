REST API Deployment Examples
----------------------------

Deploy a Marathon Application via the REST API
``````````````````````````````````````````````

In the following example, we deploy an application in Marathon with the appropriate |csi_m| labels configured.

- The app (``server-app4``) has three service ports configured; only the first two are exposed via the BIG-IP (port indices 0 and 1 are configured in the ``labels`` section).
- The ``0`` entry in the ``port-mapping`` allows Mesos to auto-allocate a port; the |csi_m| then adds that auto-allocated port number to the pool on the BIG-IP.
- For variables with a number in them (for example, ``F5_{n}_SSL_PROFILE``) ``n`` is a reference to the index in the port array.
- Because Marathon health monitors are configured, corresponding health monitors are created on the BIG-IP.

.. note:: All IP addresses shown are for demonstration purposes only.

Deploy an iApps Application via the REST API
````````````````````````````````````````````

In the following example, we deploy the "f5.http" iAppÂ® on the BIG-IP as a Marathon Application, via the Marathon REST API. [#]_

.. note::

    When deploying an iApp, you only need to use the ``IAPP`` and ``F5_PARTITION`` labels. The other parameters, such as ``F5_0_BIND_ADDR`` and ``F5_0_PORT``, are accounted for by iApp variables (``pool__addr`` and ``pool__port``, respectively).

#. Deploy the iApp in Marathon via the REST API.

    .. code-block:: shell

        curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' \
        http://<marathon_url>:8080/v2/apps -d @sample-iapp-marathon.json

    :download:`sample-marathon-application.json </static/f5-csi_m/sample-iapp-marathon.json>`


#. To verify creation of the iApp, log into the BIG-IP config utility. Be sure to look in the correct partition.

    * Go to :menuselection:`iApps --> Application Services` to view the list of Application Services.
    * Click on ``f5.http`` to view all of the objects configured as part of the iApp deployment.
