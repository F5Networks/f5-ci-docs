.. header:: Middleware Overview

F5 |lwp| |tm| is built on the Node.js :term:`middleware` framework.



The included :ref:`connection manager`, :ref:`load balancer`, and :ref:`forwarder` features are all :term:`built-in middleware` functions.

|lwp| provides helper functions that make it easy to run other `Express middleware <https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html>`_ within our middleware framework. You can also use  `third-party middleware <https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html#middleware.third-party>`_ to add functionality. See the Express documentation for more information.
