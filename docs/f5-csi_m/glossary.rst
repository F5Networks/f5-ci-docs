    device
        `BIG-IP`_ hardware or virtual edition (VE).

    device service cluster
        Device Service Clustering provides synchronization and failover of `BIG-IP`_ configuration data among multiple `BIG-IP`_ devices on a network. You can configure a `BIG-IP`_ device on a network to synchronize some or all of its configuration data among several BIG-IP devices; fail over to one of many available devices; and/or mirror connections to a peer device to prevent interruption in service during failover.

    device group
       A device group is a component of a device service cluster. It consists of a collection of `BIG-IP`_ devices that trust each other and can synchronize, and sometimes fail over, their configuration data.
